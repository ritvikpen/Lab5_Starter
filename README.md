# Check Your Understanding 
1) Yes, unit tests would be useful for testing the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are designed to verify the correctness of a specific piece of code, such as a function or method. In this case, you could write unit tests to ensure that the function responsible for creating and sending a message is working as expected. For example, you could test that a message is correctly created with the expected content and recipient, and that it is correctly added to the list of sent messages.

2) Yes, unit tests would also be useful for testing the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This is a perfect example of a feature that can be tested in isolation, which is what unit tests are designed for. You could write a test to ensure that the function responsible for enforcing the maximum message length is correctly preventing messages longer than 80 characters. For example, you could test that a message of 81 characters is not allowed, and that a message of 80 characters is allowed.
